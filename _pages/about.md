I am a 5th year PhD student at MIT Operations Research Center, and I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Patrick Jaillet](https://web.mit.edu/jaillet/www/). I am broadly interested in optimization, with a focus on developing (communication, oracle, memory, etc.) efficient algorithms for large scale problems and for sequential decision making. 

Previously, I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Columbia University in 2021 with a B.S. degree in Applied Math. Here is my [CV](https://junhuiz0.github.io/files/JunhuiZhang_cv.pdf).
